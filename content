======== WHEN ========


How long should we forward your mail for?

A year is often enough time to catch mail from seasonal or              - rephrase to start with "a year"
annual senders you may have missed notifying. You can also              - RC: phrasing feels less awkward
extend the service at any time.                                         - debate over starting with "a year" for emphasis vs first 
                                                                          clause at end

Want us to help you notify others?

We can update other organizations about your move.

Who can be notified?                                                    - can't appear between pay template and CTA
                                                                        - placement here feels like incurs extra cost
Eligible organizations must already have both your name and 
previous address on file, and they must agree to use your new 
address only to update their customer records.

To be safe, you should still notify all of your contacts about
your move.
